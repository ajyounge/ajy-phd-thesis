\documentclass[oneside,phd,etd]{IUCS}

% Specify the following optional arguments in the square brackets to
% specify the thesis type:
%
%   senior  : Produces the senior thesis preliminary pages (default)
%   honors  : Produces the honors thesis preliminary pages
%   masters : Produces the masters thesis preliminary pages
%   phd     : Produces the PhD dissertation preliminary pages
%
% The default format is appropriate for printing, with blank pages
% inserted after the preliminary pages in twoside mode so you can
% send it directly to a two-sided printer. However, for ETD
% submission the blank pages need to be removed from the final output.
% The following option does this for you:
%
%   etd     : Produces a copy with no blank pages in the preliminary section.
%             Remove this option to produce a version with blank pages inserted
%             for easy double sided printing.
%
% The rest of the class options are the same as the regular book class.
% A few to remember:
%
%   oneside : Produces single sided print layout (recommended for theses less than 50 pages)
%   twoside : Produces single sided print layout (the default if you remove oneside)
%
% The BYUPhys class provides the following macros:
%
%   \makepreliminarypages : Makes the preliminary pages
%   \clearemptydoublepage : same as \cleardoublepage but doesn't put page numbers
%                           on blank intervening pages
%   \singlespace          : switch to single spaced lines
%   \doublespace          : switch to double spaced lines
%
% --------------------------- Load Packages ---------------------------------
% The graphicx package allows the inclusion of figures.  Plain LaTeX and
% pdfLaTeX handle graphics differently. The following code checks which one
% you are compiling with, and switches the graphicx package options accordingly.
\usepackage{ifpdf} \ifpdf 
\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} \else 
\usepackage[dvips]{graphicx} \fi

% The fancyhdr package allows you to easily customize the page header.
% The settings below produce a nice, well separated header.
\usepackage{fancyhdr}
  \fancyhead{}
  \fancyhead[LO]{\slshape \rightmark}
  \fancyhead[RO,LE]{\textbf{\thepage}}
  \fancyhead[RE]{\slshape \leftmark}
  \fancyfoot{}
  \pagestyle{fancy}
  \renewcommand{\chaptermark}[1]{\markboth{\chaptername \ \thechapter \ \ #1}{}}
  \renewcommand{\sectionmark}[1]{\markright{\thesection \ \ #1}}
% The caption package allows us to change the formatting of figure captions.
% The commands here change to the suggested caption format: single spaced and a bold tag
\usepackage[margin=0.3in,labelfont=bf,labelsep=none]{caption} \DeclareCaptionFormat{suggested}{\singlespace#1#2 #3\par\doublespace} \captionsetup{format=suggested}

% The cite package cleans up the way citations are handled.  For example, it
% changes the citation [1,2,3,6,7,8,9,10,11] into [1-3,6-11].  If your advisor
% wants superscript citations, use the overcite package instead of the cite package.
\usepackage{cite}

% The makeidx package makes your index for you.  To make an index entry,
% go to the place in the book that should be referenced and type
%  \index{key}
% An index entry labeled "key" (or whatever you type) will then
% be included and point to the correct page.
\usepackage{makeidx} 
\makeindex

% The url package allows for the nice typesetting of URLs.  Since URLs are often
% long with no spaces, they mess up line wrapping.  The command \url{http://www.physics.byu.edu}
% allows LaTeX to break the url across lines at appropriate places: e.g. http://www.
% physics.byu.edu.  This is helpful if you reference web pages.
\usepackage{url} \urlstyle{rm}

% If you have a lot of equations, you might be interested in the amstex package.
% It defines a number of environments and macros that are helpful for mathematics.
% We don't do much math in this example, so we haven't used amstex here.
% The hyperref package provides automatic linking and bookmarking for the table
% of contents, index, equation references, and figure references.  It must be
% included for the BYU Physics class to make a properly functioning electronic
% thesis.  It should be the last package loaded if possible.
%
% To include a link in your pdf use \href{URL}{Text to be displayed}.  If your
% display text is the URL, you probably should use the \url{} command discussed
% above.
%
% To add a bookmark in the pdf you can use \pdfbookmark.  You can look up its usage
% in the hyperref package documentation
\usepackage[bookmarksnumbered,pdfpagelabels=true,plainpages=false,colorlinks=true, linkcolor=black,citecolor=black,urlcolor=blue]{hyperref}

% AJY specific packages
\usepackage{float}

% A two line title should be an "inverted pyramid" with the top line longer than the bottom.

\Abstract{
TODO: Compress ~250 pages and N years of your life down to a few short paragraphs here.
\\
Scientific computing endeavors have created clusters, grids, and supercomputers as HPC platforms and paradigms. These resources focus on peak performance and computing efficiency, thereby enabling scientific community to tackle non-trivial problems on massively parallel architectures. Meanwhile, efforts to leverage the economies of scale from data center operations and advances in virtualization technologies have created large scale Cloud Infrastrictire. Such Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) deployments provide mechanisms for handling millions of user interactions concurrently or organizing, cataloging, and retrieving data by allowing users to specify a custom computing environment tailored to their needs. Combining concepts from both supercomputing and clouds will enable users to leverage the performance of HPC applications with the ease and availably in clouds. 


This work proposes to bridge the gap between supercomputing and clouds using a few key aspects. First, we evaluate current hypervisors and their viability to run HPC workloads within current infrastructure. Next, we illustrate a mechanism to enable advanced accelerators such as GPUs in a Virtual Machine that can significantly enhance scientific computing problems. Furthermore, we are also able to support high speed, low latency inter-node communication through the use of InfiniBand within virtual machines.  Upon evaluating these newfound features and leveraging the system within the OpenStack environment, we illustrate that virtualzied cloud cyberinfrastructure perform at near-native speeds and support a broad range of scientific computing problems as never before.
