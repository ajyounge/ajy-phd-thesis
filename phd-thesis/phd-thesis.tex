\documentclass[oneside,phd,etd]{IUCS}

% Specify the following optional arguments in the square brackets to
% specify the thesis type:
%
%   senior  : Produces the senior thesis preliminary pages (default)
%   honors  : Produces the honors thesis preliminary pages
%   masters : Produces the masters thesis preliminary pages
%   phd     : Produces the PhD dissertation preliminary pages
%
% The default format is appropriate for printing, with blank pages
% inserted after the preliminary pages in twoside mode so you can
% send it directly to a two-sided printer. However, for ETD
% submission the blank pages need to be removed from the final output.
% The following option does this for you:
%
%   etd     : Produces a copy with no blank pages in the preliminary section.
%             Remove this option to produce a version with blank pages inserted
%             for easy double sided printing.
%
% The rest of the class options are the same as the regular book class.
% A few to remember:
%
%   oneside : Produces single sided print layout (recommended for theses less than 50 pages)
%   twoside : Produces single sided print layout (the default if you remove oneside)
%
% The BYUPhys class provides the following macros:
%
%   \makepreliminarypages : Makes the preliminary pages
%   \clearemptydoublepage : same as \cleardoublepage but doesn't put page numbers
%                           on blank intervening pages
%   \singlespace          : switch to single spaced lines
%   \doublespace          : switch to double spaced lines

% --------------------------- Load Packages ---------------------------------
% The graphicx package allows the inclusion of figures.  Plain LaTeX and
% pdfLaTeX handle graphics differently. The following code checks which one
% you are compiling with, and switches the graphicx package options accordingly.
\usepackage{ifpdf} \ifpdf 
\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} \else 
\usepackage[dvips]{graphicx} \fi

% The fancyhdr package allows you to easily customize the page header.
% The settings below produce a nice, well separated header.
\usepackage{fancyhdr}
  \fancyhead{}
  \fancyhead[LO]{\slshape \rightmark}
  \fancyhead[RO,LE]{\textbf{\thepage}}
  \fancyhead[RE]{\slshape \leftmark}
  \fancyfoot{}
  \pagestyle{fancy}
  \renewcommand{\chaptermark}[1]{\markboth{\chaptername \ \thechapter \ \ #1}{}}
  \renewcommand{\sectionmark}[1]{\markright{\thesection \ \ #1}}
% The caption package allows us to change the formatting of figure captions.
% The commands here change to the suggested caption format: single spaced and a bold tag
\usepackage[margin=0.3in,labelfont=bf,labelsep=none]{caption} \DeclareCaptionFormat{suggested}{\singlespace#1#2 #3\par\doublespace} \captionsetup{format=suggested}

% The cite package cleans up the way citations are handled.  For example, it
% changes the citation [1,2,3,6,7,8,9,10,11] into [1-3,6-11].  If your advisor
% wants superscript citations, use the overcite package instead of the cite package.
\usepackage{cite}

% The makeidx package makes your index for you.  To make an index entry,
% go to the place in the book that should be referenced and type
%  \index{key}
% An index entry labeled "key" (or whatever you type) will then
% be included and point to the correct page.
\usepackage{makeidx} 
\makeindex

% The url package allows for the nice typesetting of URLs.  Since URLs are often
% long with no spaces, they mess up line wrapping.  The command \url{http://www.physics.byu.edu}
% allows LaTeX to break the url across lines at appropriate places: e.g. http://www.
% physics.byu.edu.  This is helpful if you reference web pages.
\usepackage{url} \urlstyle{rm}

% If you have a lot of equations, you might be interested in the amstex package.
% It defines a number of environments and macros that are helpful for mathematics.
% We don't do much math in this example, so we haven't used amstex here.
% The hyperref package provides automatic linking and bookmarking for the table
% of contents, index, equation references, and figure references.  It must be
% included for the BYU Physics class to make a properly functioning electronic
% thesis.  It should be the last package loaded if possible.
%
% To include a link in your pdf use \href{URL}{Text to be displayed}.  If your
% display text is the URL, you probably should use the \url{} command discussed
% above.
%
% To add a bookmark in the pdf you can use \pdfbookmark.  You can look up its usage
% in the hyperref package documentation

\Abstract{
With the advent of virtualization and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), the broader scientific computing community is considering the use of clouds for their scientific computing needs. This is due to the relative scalability, ease of use, advanced user environment customization abilities, and the many novel computing paradigms available for data-intensive applications. However, a notable performance gap exists between IaaS and typical high performance computing (HPC) resources. This has limited the applicability of IaaS for many potential users, not only for those who look to leverage the benefits of virtualization with traditional scientific computing applications, but also for the growing number of big data scientists whose platforms are unable to build on HPC's advanced hardware resources.

Concurrently, we are at the forefront of a convergence in infrastructure between Big Data and HPC, in which a unified distributed computing architecture could provide computing and storage capabilities for both differing distributed systems use cases. There is the potential to leverage performance and advanced hardware from the HPC community, and provide it in a virtualized infrastructure using High Performance Virtual Clusters. This will not only enable a more diverse user environment within supercomputing applications, but also bring increased performance and capabilities to big data platform services. 

This work proposes to bridge the gap between HPC and cloud infrastructure and enable infrastructure convergence through a framework for virtual clusters. It begins with an evaluation of current hypervisors and their viability to run HPC workloads within current infrastructure, which helps define existing performance gaps. Next, we uncover mechanisms to enable the use of specialized hardware available in many HPC resources, such as advanced accelerators like the Nvidia GPUs and high-speed, low-latency InfiniBand interconnects. The virtualized infrastructure that developed, which leverages such specialized HPC hardware and utilizes best-practices virtualization using KVM, supports advanced Molecular Dynamics simulations at near-native performance. These advances are incorporated into a framework for constructing distributed virtual clusters using the OpenStack cloud infrastructure. With high performance virtual clusters, we look to support a broad range of scientific computing challenges, from HPC simulations to big data analytics with a single, unified infrastructure.

%Scientific computing endeavors have created clusters, grids, and supercomputers as HPC platforms and paradigms. These resources focus on peak performance and computing efficiency, thereby enabling scientific community to tackle non-trivial problems on massively parallel architectures. Meanwhile, efforts to leverage the economies of scale from data center operations and advances in virtualization technologies have created large scale Cloud Infrastructure. Such Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) deployments provide mechanisms for handling millions of user interactions concurrently or organizing, cataloging, and retrieving data by allowing users to specify a custom computing environment tailored to their needs. Combining concepts from both supercomputing and clouds will enable users to leverage the performance of HPC applications with the ease and availably in clouds.

%This work proposes to bridge the gap between supercomputing and clouds using a few key aspects. First, we evaluate current hypervisors and their viability to run HPC workloads within current infrastructure. Next, we illustrate a mechanism to enable advanced accelerators such as GPUs in a Virtual Machine that can significantly enhance scientific computing problems. Furthermore, we are also able to support high speed, low latency inter-node communication through the use of InfiniBand within virtual machines.  Upon evaluating these newfound features and leveraging the system within the OpenStack environment, we illustrate that virtualzied cloud cyberinfrastructure perform at near-native speeds and support a broad range of scientific computing problems as never before.

\Acknowledgments{

I am grateful to many, many people for making this dissertation work possible.

First, I want to express my sincere gratitude and admiration to my advisor, Geoffrey Fox.  Geoffrey has provided invaluable advice, knowledge, insight, and direction in a way that without which, this dissertation would not exist. It has been a distinct honor and privilege working with him which I will carry with me throughout my career. 

I would like to thank my committee members, Judy Qiu, Thomas Sterling, and Martin Swany. The guidance received in the formation of this dissertation has been of great help and a fruitful learning experience I will never forget.  The insights given by these members throughout the dissertation writing have proven exceptionally helpful, and I have learned a great deal working with them. I also want to explicitly thank Judy Qiu for giving me the opportunity to be a part of her Distributed Systems and Cloud Computing courses over the years.  This teaching experience has taught me how to be a better lecturer and mentor.

Over the years I have had the pleasure of working with a number of members in the Data Science Center lab and others throughout Indiana University.  I would like to thank Javier Diaz-Montes, Thilina Ekanayaka, Saliya Ekanayaka, Xiaoming Gao, Robert Henschel, Supun Kamburugamuve, Nate Keith, Gary Miksik, Jerome Mitchell, Julie Overfield, Greg Pike, Allan Streib, Koji Tanaka, Gregor von Laszewski, Fugang Wang, Stephen Wu, and Yudou Zhou.  Many of these individuals have helped me directly throughout my tenure at Indiana University and their effort and support of over the years is greatly appreciated.

I would like to express my gratefulness to the APEX team at the University Of Southern California Information Sciences Institute, where I was a visiting researcher and intern in 2012 and 2013. In this, I would like to give a special thanks to John Paul Walters at USC/ISI who worked directly with me on many of the research endeavors within this dissertation. JP has provided hands-on mentorship that helped create the basis of this dissertation, and his leadership is one in which I look to emulate in the future. I would also like to thank the Persistent Systems Fellowship through the School of Informatics and Computing for providing me with a fellowship to fund the last three years of my PhD.

I would also like to give thanks to the many close friends and roommates in Bloomington, Indiana over the years. Specifically, I’d like to thank Ahmed El-Hassany, Jason Hemann, Matthew Jaffee, Aubrey Kelly, Haley McCloud, Brent McGill, Krithika Rajaram, Andrea Sorenson, Dane Sorenson, and Miao Zhang. I’d like to make a special acknowledgement to my friends in the Bloomington cycling community, many of whom have become my Bloomington pseudo-family. This includes John Brooks, Michael Wallis Jr, Kasey Poracky, Brian Gessler, Niki Gessler, Davy McDonald, Jess Bare, Ian Yarbrough, Kelsey Thetonia, Pete Stuttgen, Mike Fox, Tom Schwoegler, and the Chi Omega Little 500 cycling team.   In this, I specifically need to acknowledge two wonderful people, John Brooks and Larice Thoroughgood for their support, patience, and forbearance during the final stages in of my Ph.D. Larice has provided the love and encouragement necessary to see this dissertation through to the end. John has donated countless hours of his time helping me edit and revise this manuscript, along with many after-hour philosophical discussions. Without all of these wonderful people in my life here in Bloomington, this dissertation would have likely been completed many months earlier.

Last but not least, I want to thank my parents Mary and Wayne Younge, my sisters Bethany Younge and Elizabeth Keller, and the rest of my extended family for their unwavering love and support over the years. Words cannot fully express the gratitude and love I have for you all.
